Project Description
Today’s project is all about cleaning up data — a crucial step in any real-world application. 
Your task is to build a Python program that removes duplicate values from a list provided by the user.

But here's the twist: instead of using a hardcoded list, your program should prompt the user
to input a list of values separated by commas (for example: apple, banana, apple, orange).


The program should then:

Convert the input into a list

Remove any duplicate entries

Print the cleaned list

And show how many duplicates were removed

This kind of functionality is useful in many real-life scenarios — think of cleaning up email lists,
form submissions, tags in a blog system, or even log entries. It’s a great exercise in input handling,
string manipulation, and basic data processing.
